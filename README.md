# VulnGuard

This project aims to develop a comprehensive blockchain security system centered around an upgradeable smart contract with a known vulnerability. The system is designed to detect, notify, and prevent potential exploits, providing a robust framework for understanding and mitigating smart contract vulnerabilities.
